Here are various fix / modifications for fas2

You need FAS2 for TTT, this is just a patch.

Because we doesn't like the normal fas2 shotguns behavior, I modded it to the normal one.

- Looks way more beatiful as the normal one, fas2 style, animations, physics, ...
- shots 8 bullets
- bullets do 11 dmg
- bullet spread like the default one, just with fas2 calculated
- bullet dmg dropoff like the default one
- clipsize 8 like the default one
- no reload between shots needed
